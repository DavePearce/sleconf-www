title: ACM SIGPLAN SLE Conference - Most Influential Paper Award
published: true
---


Starting in 2019, the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) delivers annually an award to the Most Influential Paper (MIP) presented at the SLE conference held 10 years prior to the award year. The SLE MIP Award distinguishes the authors of the paper having the greatest impact (either scientific, societal or industrial). The papers are judged by their influence over the past decade. The SLE MIP Award is delivered by the current members of the Steering Committee (SC) of the conference, considering: i) endorsements from the community, and ii) the synthesis of some facts and metrics collected in advance by selected SC members. The vote is by majority of the SC members, after a discussion during the online meetings. Authors are informed at once, and awarded at the coming conference.  

In 2019 we offer two awards: one for the authors of the MIP from the 2009 program ([http://www.sleconf.org/2009/Program.html](http://www.sleconf.org/2009/Program.html)), and another one for the authors of the MIP from the 2008 program ([http://www.sleconf.org/2008/program.html](http://www.sleconf.org/2008/program.html)), back to the first edition of the conference.
