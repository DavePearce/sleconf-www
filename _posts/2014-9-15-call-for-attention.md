Welcome to the 7th International Conference on Software Language Engineering.

---

### 7:30am

This is a semi-live blog from the audience of SLE. We are in parallel sessions with GPCE and it is clear that we've been working together as a team uptil now, but from here on we are in competition for the attention of the audience :-)

What is SLE to us, the community? It is a conference where artificial boundaries between sub-fields in software engineering have been lifted. The language perspective on software engineering is unifying. 

SLE is a community in which we freely switch between _technological spaces_ -even studying them from a distance- not bound by any socio-cultural limitations. This generates the cross-overs and AHA!'s that bring us a deeper understanding of what software is and how we may predict and control its quality.

We study language engineering without exceptions, for example:

   * SLE provides the computer science perspective on _model driven engineering_ 
   * SLE is the generalization of compiler construction conferences to _metaprogramming_ in-the-large.
   * SLE introduces a programming languages perspective on _information engineering_
   
I hope you will enjoy the 7th instance of SLE. Please feel free to provide any constructive feedback that we may use to make it even better.

### SLE 2014 starts at 8:30 in the room called "HÃ¶rsalen".

### 9:00am

Colin Atkinson bridges viewpoint engineering to language engineering in his invited talk. It's about time! It emphasizes that the language view on software engineering also includes the field of software architecture.
