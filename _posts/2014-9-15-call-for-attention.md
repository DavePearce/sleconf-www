Welcome to the 7th International Conference on Software Language Engineering.

---

This is a semi-live blog from the audience of SLE. We are in parallel sessions with GPCE and it is clear that we've been working together as a team uptil now, but from here on we are in competition for the attention of the audience :-)

What is SLE to us, the community? It is a conference where artificial boundaries between sub-fields in software engineering have been lifted. The language perspective on software engineering is unifying. 

SLE is a community in which we freely switch between _technological spaces_ -even studying them from a distance-, not bound by any socio-cultural limitations. This generates the cross-overs and AHA!'s that bring us a deeper understanding of what software is and how we may predict and control its quality.

We study language engineering without exceptions: 

   * SLE provides the computer science perspective on _model driven engineering_ 
   * SLE is the generalization of compiler construction conferences to _meta programming_ in-the-large.
   * SLE introduces a programming languages perspective on _information engineering_
