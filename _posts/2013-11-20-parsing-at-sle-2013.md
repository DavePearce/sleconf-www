## Reporting on the first workshop on Parsing@SLE

In 2013 we organized the first workshop on Parsing at SLE (Parsing@SLE) as a pre-conference workshop with SLE in Indianapolis. The goal of this workshop was to bring together as many parsing experts as possible and find out what the state-of-the-art in parsing technology is and what the future will hold. 

Parsing@SLE is also a vehicle for sparking the interest of more people to join the SLE community.

### Participation

During the summer of 2013 we did a targeted email offensive, inviting everybody who has ever written a parser generator or maintained one, wrote a paper about it or blogged about it to the workshop. As a result we had 40 enthousiastic participants at the workshop!  

### Format

The format of the workshop was as follows:

* We invited people to submit short position papers
* From the 13 submissions we composed an interactive program.
