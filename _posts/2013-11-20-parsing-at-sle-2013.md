In 2013 we organized the first workshop on Parsing at SLE (Parsing@SLE) as a pre-conference workshop with SLE in Indianapolis. The goal of this workshop was to bring together as many parsing experts as possible and find out what the state-of-the-art in parsing technology is and what the future will hold. 

Parsing@SLE is also a vehicle for sparking the interest of more people to join the SLE community.

### Participation

During the summer of 2013 we did a targeted email offensive, inviting everybody who has ever written a parser generator or maintained one, wrote a paper about it or blogged about it to the workshop. As a result we had 40 enthousiastic participants at the workshop!  

### Format

The format of the workshop was as follows:

* We invited people to submit short position papers.
* From the 13 submissions we composed an interactive program, comprising of:
   - 10 minute talks, hard time limits
   - inter-mixed with longer discussions, free form
   - tightly scheduled coffee breaks
   
It seems that this formula is good for this kind of workshop, because the attendees expressed unanimously that the workshop was enjoyable and useful.

We started in the morning by having 3 times 10 minute talks in one block and then 30 minutes of discussion, but after lunch we moved naturally to 10 minute talks interspersed by 10 minute discussions. 

The discussions were usually sparked by the presentations but did not always stick to the original point, and we did not force this either. This freedom of discussion topic was deemed to be good for this first instance of parsing@SLE, but some participants expressed the hope that next year at least a part of the day would also be reserved for focused discussion on particular topics.

Example topics that were proposed to focus on next year:

   * The principled definition, evaluation and comparison of parser run-time behavior on typical use cases, as opposed to plain old worst case analysis or benchmarking without a background theory of what it is that parsers do at run-time.
   * Implementation tactics: what makes the difference between a fast and a slow parser implementation.
   * Off-the-beaten-track: step away from the parsing-takes-a-string-as-input-and-produces-a-tree-as-output meme, what else is like parsing and what other effects to parsers have? Example is "abstract parsing", "incremental parsing"
   
### Output

As output of Parsing@SLE 2013 we can mention:
   * parsing@sleconf.org - mailing list of interested participants
   * new SLE community members
   * a handful of registrants who came only for Parsing@SLE.

### Testimonials

At the end of the workshop we asked each individual participant what he or she got out of attending this workshop. The following list summarizes the responses, removing duplicates and generalizing towards sound bites:
