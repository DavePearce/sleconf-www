The 8th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of [software languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_language): their design, their implementation, and their evolution. 

SLE 2015 is to be held 25-27 October 2015, co-located with [SPLASH](http://2015.splashcon.org/) and [GPCE](http://program-transformation.org/GPCE15) in [Pittsburg, USA]. 

SLE's mission is to fuse several communities that have traditionally looked at software languages from different and yet complementary perspectives: programming languages, model driven engineering, domain specific languages, semantic web, and from different technological spaces: context-free grammars, object-oriented modeling frameworks, rich data, structured data, object-oriented programming, functional programming, logic programming, term-rewriting, attribute grammars, algebraic specification, etc.

SLE's proceedings are published by the ACM and will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

The next edition, **[SLE 2016](http://www.sleconf.org/2016/)**, will be co-located with [SPLASH 2016](http://2016.splashcon.org/) at the [MÃ¶venpick Hotel, Amsterdam, Netherlands](http://2016.splashcon.org/venue/movenpick-amsterdam). See you there!
