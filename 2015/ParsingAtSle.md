# Parsing@SLE 2015
 
## About
 
Parsing@SLE is a workshop on parsing programming languages, now in its third edition. The intended participants are the authors of parser generation tools and parsers for programming languages and other software languages. For the purpose of this workshop ``parsing’’ is a computation that takes a sequence of characters as input and produces a syntax tree or graph as output. This possibly includes tokenization using regular expressions, deriving trees using context- free grammars, and mapping to abstract syntax trees. The goal is to bring together today’s experts in the field of parsing, in order to explore open questions and possibly forge new collaborations. The topics may include algorithms, implementation and generation techniques, syntax and semantics of meta formalisms (BNF), etc.
 
## Topics
While parsing and parser generation, both in theory and in practice, are mature topics, there are still many challenging problems with respect to the construction, maintenance, optimization, and application of parsers in real-world scenarios.
 
Especially in the context of real programming languages there are ample theoretical as well as practical obstacles to be overcome. Contemporary parsing challenges are caused by programming-language evolution and diversity in the face of new application areas such as IDE construction, reverse engineering, software metrics, domain specific (embedded) languages, etc. What are modular formalisms for parser generation? How to obtain (fast and correct) parsers for both legacy and new languages that require more computational power than context-free grammars and regular expressions can provide? How to use increasing parallelism offered by multi-cores and GPUs in parsers? How to enable the verified construction or prototyping of parsers for languages such as COBOL, C++ and Scala without years of effort?
 
In addition to the traditional programming-language applications of parsing technology, several other areas of computing also depend heavily on parsers. Examples include computational linguistics, network traffic classification, network security, and bioinformatics. Those areas often have their own unusual requirements, such as: speed (e.g. in network algorithmics), memory efficiency (e.g. embedded devices for networks, but also computational linguistics), or rapid/dynamic parser construction (e.g. in network traffic classification and in bioinformatics) as grammars are adapted. We encourage talk proposals on parsing challenges and solutions in such non-traditional areas as well.

## Call for Talk Proposals
We solicit talk proposals in the form of short abstracts (max. 2 pages in ACM 2-column format). A good talk proposal describes an interesting position, demonstration, or early achievement. The submissions will be reviewed on relevance and clarity, and used to plan the mostly interactive sessions of the workshop day. Parsing@SLE is not a publication venue. Publication of accepted abstracts and slides on the website is voluntary. Talk proposal abstracts should be [submitted via EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=parsingsle2015).
 
Submission deadline for talk proposals: (August 7th) extended to August 31st
 
Notification on or before: September 7th
