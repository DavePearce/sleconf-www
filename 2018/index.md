The 11th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of [software languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_language): their design, their implementation, and their evolution.

SLE 2018 is to be held on November 5th and 6th 2018, co-located with [SPLASH](http://2018.splashcon.org/) and [GPCE](http://conf.researchr.org/home/gpce-2018) in Boston, USA. More details will follow in the next months.

SLE's mission is to fuse several communities that have traditionally looked at software languages from different and yet complementary perspectives: programming languages, model driven engineering, domain specific languages, semantic web, and from different technological spaces: context-free grammars, object-oriented modeling frameworks, rich data, structured data, object-oriented programming, functional programming, logic programming, term-rewriting, attribute grammars, algebraic specification, etc.
