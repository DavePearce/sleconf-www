We are very proud to announce that this yearâ€™s SLE keynote will be given by Martin Rinard from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Martin Rinard is professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. His research focuses on software systems and related topics. The broad goal of his research is to obtain better software - making software more robust, resilient, and secure, improving the performance, verifying that the software satisfies important correctness, acceptability, reliability, or accuracy properties, or making systems (both software and hardware) easier to specify, build, maintain, or improve. 

More information on his research can be found at [http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/). Details about his keynote at SLE will be announced soon.
