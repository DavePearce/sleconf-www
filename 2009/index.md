The International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is a conference series devoted to topics related to artificial languages in software engineering. SLE is an international research forum that aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia to expand the frontiers of software language engineering.Historically, SLE emerged from two established workshop series: LDTA, Language Descriptions, Tools, and Applications, which has been a satellite event at ETAPS for the last 9 years, and ATEM which has been co-located with MODELS and WCRE for the last 5 years. These, as well as several other conferences and workshops, have investigated various aspects of language design, implementation, and evolution but from different perspectives.

SLE's foremost mission is to encourage and organize communication between communities that have traditionally looked at software languages from different, more specialized, and yet complementary perspectives. SLE emphasizes the fundamental notion of languages as opposed to any realization in specific "technical spaces".

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.

SLE2009 is the second edition of the SLE conference series, which started by very successful SLE 2008. SLE 2009 will be co-located with the 12th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS'09) as well as 8th International Conference on Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE'09).
