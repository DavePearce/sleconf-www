title: Doctoral Symposium
layout: default2012
---

The International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) aims to bring together the different sub-communities of the software-language-engineering community to foster cross-fertilisation and to strengthen research overall.

Within this context the Doctoral Symposium at SLE 2012 contributes towards these goals by providing a forum for both early and late-stage PhD students to present their research and get detailed feedback and advice from researchers both in and out of their particular research area.

### Objectives

The main objectives of this event are:

* to provide PhD students with an opportunity to write about and present their research
* to provide PhD students with constructive feedback on their work from their peers and from established researchers in their own and in different SLE sub-communities
* to build bridges for potential research collaboration
* to foster integrated thinking about SLE challenges crossing the boundaries between sub-communities
* to encourage discussion about research methodology

Besides research topics as mentioned in the SLE conference positioning, we explicitly solicit papers that address

unusual cross-domain aspects of software languages,
practical application of software language engineering concepts in real world examples, commercial or non-commercial, or
usage and usability aspects of software languages for non-IT and non-research audience
as well.

Furthermore, we encourage PhD students to submit papers about research aspects of and connected to software language engineering, even if not explicitly mentioned in the positioning of SLE and doctoral symposium in order to start exchange of such research ideas in the community.  

### Important Dates

* Deadline for submission: July 10, 2012
* Notification of acceptance: August 20, 2012
* Deadline for revisions:September 7, 2012
* Doctoral Symposium: September 25, 2012

<h4>Symposium Format</h4>
<p>The Symposium will include a keynote about a topic that addresses methodological aspects of research. The symposium will follow an interactive approach where presenters, discussants and the audience can engage in a fruitful discussion about the presented research topics. It includes multiple sessions with a total of about 10 papers. After each paper presentation of about 15 minutes the paper will be directly discussed by pre-assigned discussants and then the discussion will be extended to the wider audience.</p>
<p>The symposium language is English.</p>
