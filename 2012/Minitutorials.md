The following minitutorials will be held at SLE:

### Eelco Visser and Guido Wachsmuth: "A Guide to Grammarware"

We present a guide to grammarware for researchers with a modelware background, discussing the specification and implementation of various language aspects with grammarware technologies. The guide covers concrete and abstract syntax, name binding, types and constraints, model-to-model transformation, code generation, and execution. For each aspect, we point out possible grammarware approaches, connect and compare them to modelware approaches, survey important grammarware research results, and identify current grammarware research questions. Throughout the guide, we use OCL as the example language. The guide is accompanied by an OCL implementation in the Spoofax language workbench.

### Richard Paige, Dimitrios Kolovos and Fiona Polack: "Metamodeling for Grammarware Researchers"

A metamodel is variously defined as a model of a model, a definition of a language, a description of abstract syntax, and a description of a domain. It is all of these things and more. Metamodels can be confusing, and explaining why they are constructed, what you can do with them, and how they are constructed can be challenging, especially when trying to bridge the gap between the modelware and grammarware communities. In this example-driven mini-tutorial, we introduce the key concepts and ideas behind metamodelling and explain why metamodels are useful, and particularly how they differ from grammar-based approaches to language development. We give some tips on how grammarware researchers can explain what they do to modelware researchers, and vice versa, in the spirit of interdisciplinarity and improving collaboration.

### Giancarlo Guizzardi and Veruska Zamborlini: "A Common Foundational Theory for Bridging two levels in Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling"

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use Foundational Ontologies, i.e., ontological theories in the philosophical sense to provide real-world semantics and principled modeling guidelines for conceptual domain modeling languages. In this paper, we demonstrate how a philosophically sound and cognitively-oriented ontological theory of objects and moments (property-instances) has been used to: (i) (re)design a system of modeling primitives underlying the conceptual domain modeling language OntoUML; (ii) derive supporting technology for mapping these conceptual domain models to less-expressive computationally-oriented codification languages. In particular, we address here a mapping strategy to OWL (Web Ontology Language) which ad-dresses the issue of temporally changing information.
