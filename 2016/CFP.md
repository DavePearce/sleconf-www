# CALL FOR PAPERS

Please also consider the [Instructions for Authors](http://sleconf.org/2016/InstructionsForAuthors.html).

### Topics of Interest

SLE aims to be broad-minded and inclusive about relevance and scope. We solicit high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain of language engineering. Topics relevant to SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather than aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is interested in principled engineering approaches and techniques in the following areas:

- Language Design and Implementation
    - Approaches and methodologies for language design 
    - Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints)
    - Techniques for behavioral / executable semantics
    - Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation)
    - Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches
- Language Validation
     - Verification and formal methods for languages
     - Testing techniques for languages
     - Simulation techniques for languages
- Language Integration
     - Coordination between of heterogeneous languages and tools
     - Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages)
     - Traceability between languages
     - Deployment of languages to different platforms
- Language Maintenance
     - Software language reuse
     - Language evolution 
     - Language families and variability 
- Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance)
- Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools
      - User studies evaluating usability 
      -  Performance benchmarks
      -  Industrial applications

### Types of Submissions

- **Research papers**: These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography (in [ACM SIGPLAN conference style](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/)).

- **Tool papers**: Because of SLE's interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (see above), with 1 optional additional page for bibliographic references, and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 4 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords “Tool Demo” or “Tool Demonstration” in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 4-page demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission.

**Workshops:** Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience.


### Publications

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. All accepted papers, including tool papers will be published in ACM Digital Library.  

Authors of distinguished papers from the conference will be invited to revise and submit extended versions of their papers for a Journal special issue.

### Awards

- Distinguished paper. Award for most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee.

- Distinguished reviewer. Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs using feedback from the authors.

### More Information

For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions please contact the Program Chair.
