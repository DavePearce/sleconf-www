The 1st International Conference on Software Language Engineering
(SLE) is devoted to topics related to artificial languages in software
engineering. SLE's foremost mission is to encourage and organize
communication between communities that have traditionally looked at
software languages from different, more specialized, and yet
complementary perspectives. SLE emphasizes the fundamental notion of
languages as opposed to any realization in specific "technical
spaces".

## Scope

The term "software language" comprises all sorts of artificial
languages used in software development including general purpose
programming languages, domain-specific languages, modeling and meta-
modeling languages, data models, and ontologies. We use this term in
its broadest sense. Thus, for example, modeling languages include UML
and UML-based languages, synchronous languages used in safety critical
applications, business process modeling languages, and web application
modeling languages, to name a few. Perhaps less obviously, the term
"software language" also comprises APIs and collections of design
patterns that are indeed implicitly defined languages.

Software language engineering is the application of a systematic,
disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, use, and
maintenance of these languages. Thus, the SLE conference is concerned
with all phases of the lifecycle of software languages; these include
the design, implementation, documentation, testing, deployment,
evolution, recovery, and retirement of languages. Of special interest
are tools, techniques, methods and formalisms that support these
activities. In particular, tools are often based on or even
automatically generated from a formal description of the
language. Hence, of special interest is the treatment of language
descriptions as software artifacts, akin to programs - while paying
attention to the special status of language descriptions, subject to
tailored engineering principles and methods for modularization,
refactoring, refinement, composition, versioning, co- evolution, and
analysis.

## Themes and Topics

We solicit high-quality contributions in the area of SLE ranging from
theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques and
frameworks that support the aforementioned lifecycle activities. Some
examples of tools, techniques, applications, and problems are listed
below in order to clarify the types of contributions sought by SLE.

* Formalisms used in designing and specifying languages and tools that
analyze such language descriptions 
* Language implementation tools and techniques
* Program and model transformation tools
* Composition, integration, and mapping tools for managing different
aspects of software languages or different manifestations of a given language
* Language evolution
* Approaches to elicitation, specification, and verification of
requirements for software languages 
* Language development frameworks, methodologies, techniques, best
practices, and tools for the broader language lifecycle covering
phases such as analysis, testing, and documentation. 
* Design challenges in SLE
* Applications of languages including innovative domain-specific
languages or "little" languages 

Do note that this list is not exclusive and many examples of tools,
techniques, approaches have not been listed. The program committee
chairs encourage potential contributors to contact them with questions
about the scope and topics of interest to SLE.

## Submission Guidelines and Publishing

Submitted articles must not have been previously published or
currently be submitted elsewhere. All submitted papers will be closely
reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. All
accepted papers will be made available at the conference in the
pre-proceedings and published in the post-proceedings of the
conference, which will appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series. Authors will have the opportunity to revise their
accepted paper for the pre and post- proceedings.
