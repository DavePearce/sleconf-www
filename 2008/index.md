The 1st International Conference on Software Language Engineering
(SLE) is devoted to topics related to artificial languages in software
engineering. SLE is an international research forum that aims to bring
together researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia
to expand the frontiers of software language engineering.Historically,
SLE emerged from two established workshop series: LDTA, Language
Descriptions, Tools, and Applications, which has been a satellite
event at ETAPS for the last 8 years, and ATEM which has been
co-located with MODELS and WCRE for the last 5 years. These, as well
as several other conferences and workshops, have investigated various
aspects of language design, implementation, and evolution but from
different perspectives. 

SLE's foremost mission is to encourage and organize communication
between communities that have traditionally looked at software
languages from different, more specialized, and yet complementary
perspectives. SLE emphasizes the fundamental notion of languages as
opposed to any realization in specific "technical spaces". 

This year SLE will be co-located with the 11th IEEE/ACM International
Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS
2008), in Toulouse, France.
