ITSLE is a workshop to bring together people from industry and academia working on domain specific languages and model driven software engineering. The workshop is a continuation of successful workshops organized in 2011 and 2012.

## Aim and Scope
Software Language Engineering based techniques, such as Domain Specific Languages and Model Driven Software Engineering, are used more and more within industry. This shows the strength and potential of DSLs and MDSE. However, it is clear that industry is still in an explorative phase. There are still a number of challenges to be addressed, for instance, with respect to scalability of these techniques, efficient tool development for these techniques, the methodology of using these techniques, and evolution and (version) management of the developed artifacts. These challenges have to be resolved in order to convince industry to start using these techniques on a very large scale.

The Industry Track is dedicated to industrial research on and application of SLE based techniques, including industry oriented work done in universities and research organizations. We seek high-quality contributions from practitioners as well as industrial and academic researchers. We promote industrial partners to exchange their experiences with SLE based techniques.

## Topics
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- industrial research results
- academic research results that have been applied or have a potential application in an industrial field
- experience reports on industrial SLE projects and applications
- tool presentations, of industrial-strength commercial tools as well as novel academic tools that have not yet industrial strength, but address a real industrial need
- industrial challenges, best practices, guidelines and pitfalls.

## Workshop Goals and Format
The goal of this workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners from academia and industry together to learn more about the challenges each faces by applying MBE in industry. This event is not a mini-conference; it will be run in the style of a retreat that will include short talks, tool demonstrations, and mini-tutorials. The aim is to keep it as informal and interactive as possible.

## Call for Papers
### Type of Papers
We solicit the following types of papers:

- **Research papers**: These should report a substantial research contribution to ITSLE and/or successful application of SLE techniques. Full paper submissions must not exceed 20 pages.
- **Experience reports**: The objective of experience reports is to discuss results (both good and bad), obstacles, and lessons learned associated with applying SLE techniques in the "real world". Experiences from practitioners provide valuable input into future research directions and allow others to learn from successes and failures. These papers must not exceed 10 pages.
- **Tool demonstration papers**: Because of ITSLE's ample interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE. These papers will accompany a tool demonstration to be given at the workshop. These papers must not exceed 10 pages. The selection criteria include the innovative aspects of the tool and the relevance of the tool to industrial application. Submissions may also include an appendix (that will not be published) containing additional screen-shots and discussion of the proposed demonstration.

### Paper submission
Contributed papers must not have been previously published or currently be submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Research papers will be evaluated on the basis of originality of the work, contribution to the state-of-the-art, and overall interest to industrial application of SLE techniques.
- Experience reports will be evaluated on the basis of clarity of the motivation for the work, and the relevance to the industrial and academic SLE community.
- Tool demonstration papers will be evaluated on technical foundations, novelty, and on industrial relevance like stability, robustness and its potential for broad application.

These workshop contributions have to be submitted via EasyChair:
[https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itsle2014](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itsle2014). The submission deadline is July 15. For these submissions no particular style is required.

##  Proceedings
Proceedings
The workshop proceedings will be published as a CEUR Workshop Proceedings. For the workshop proceedings accepted papers must be formatted according to the CEUR one-column style.

##  Important Dates
- Submission deadline of papers: July 15
- Notification to authors: August 15
- Final papers due: August 30
- Workshop: September 14

##  Keynote
Stéphane Bonnet (Thales Corporate Engineering) will give a keynote to share his rich experience in delivering MDE-based and DSL-based solutions in industrial context. 

Thales is a major electronic systems company that designs, builds and provides services for the aerospace, defense, transportation, space and security markets. For the last ten years, Thales has massively invested on model driven approaches, both from methodological and tooling perspectives. The Thales DSL for system architecture definition is named Capella and is both an enrichment and a simplification of UML and SysML. It is now at the core of the Thales engineering practices.

- What was the initial rationale for a DSL?
- What technologies have been used or developed to build this DSL?
- What are the key enabling factors to massively deploy a DSL in such a large organization?
- How did the Thales strategy evolve over the years to end up with open sourcing both Capella and the major technological bricks it relies on (Sirius, Kitalpha)?

Stéphane Bonnet has joined Thales in 2005 after completing a PhD on model driven engineering and software factories for the smart card manufacturer Gemalto. He has been involved in the first significant Thales efforts to provide model driven engineering solutions through advanced UML profiles. From 2008 onwards, he has led the development of Capella, the Thales modeling DSL for system engineering, now used by hundreds of engineers from various engineering domains. He now spends most of his time helping Thales system engineers deploy model driven engineering approaches on operational projects worldwide and contributing to the Thales open sourcing effort.
