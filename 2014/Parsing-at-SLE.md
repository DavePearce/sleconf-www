### Topic

The topics of parsing and parser generation, both in theory and in practice, may be old, yet there are still challenging problems with respect to the construction and maintenance of parsers. Especially in the context of real programming languages there are ample theoretical as well as practical obstacles to be taken. Contemporary parsing challenges are caused by programming language evolution and diversity in the face of new application areas such as IDE construction, reverse engineering, software metrics, domain specific (embedded) languages, etc. What are modular meta-formalisms for parser generation? How to obtain (fast and correct) parsers for both legacy and new languages that require more computational power than context-free grammars and regular expressions can provide? How to enable the verified construction or prototyping of parsers for languages such as COBOL, C++ and Scala without years of effort?

### Goal

The goal of this workshop is a retreat: to bring together today's experts in the field of parser construction for programming languages. We will present the currently ongoing (unpublished) work as well as explore the challenges that lie ahead. By bringing the whole community together we hope to create synergy and forge new collaborations. Parsing@SLE is a part of the larger SLE conference.

Parsing @ SLE is not a publication venue. We will collect minutes and the slides of the presentations and publish them online for later reference. However we will surely allow authors to keep the slides for themselves and keep some comments off the record, for example pending publication of recent results.
