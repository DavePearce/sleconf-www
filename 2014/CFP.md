# CALL FOR PAPERS

### Scope

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the application of systematic,
disciplined, and measurable approaches to the development, use, deployment, and
maintenance of software languages.   The term "software language" is used
broadly, and includes:  general-purpose programming languages; domain-specific
languages (e.g. BPMN, Simulink, Modelica); modeling and metamodeling languages
(e.g. SysML and UML); data models and ontologies (e.g.  XML-based and OWL-based
languages and vocabularies).  Topics of Interest

The overall principle of SLE is to be broad-minded and inclusive about relevance and scope.  We solicit high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques, and frameworks. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Tools and methods for software language design and extension (incl. meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches)
* Generative approaches, transformation and transformation languages, code generation
* Techniques for analysing software language descriptions
* Techniques for software language reuse, evolution and managing variation (syntactic/semantic) within language families 
* Integration and coordination of software languages and tools
* Engineering Domain-Specific Languages (for modeling, simulating, generation, description, checking)
* Novel applications and/or empirical studies on any aspect of SLE (development, use, deployment, and maintenance of software languages)
* Cross-fertilization of different technological spaces (e.g. modelware, grammarware, etc)

### Types of Submissions

* Research papers: These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 20 pages (in LNCS format).
* Tool papers: Because of SLE's ample interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE.  Selection criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE.  Tool papers should include an appendix outlining the proposed demonstration, including screenshots etc. A short video may be linked as well.  Tool paper submissions must not 10 pages (in LNCS Format).
* Industrial position papers: These papers discuss practical applications of SLE technology with an emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of the method, techniques, or tools used.  Industry paper submissions must not 10 pages (in LNCS Format).
* Bridging position papers: These papers discuss bridging ideas from the different areas of SLE (e.g. modelling, PL, grammars, etc).   This includes both foundational ideas and/or practical techniques.  Bridging position papers must not 4 pages (in LNCS Format).

All papers have to be submitted electronically in pdf format via Easychair: <https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sle2014>

Papers should follow the LNCS format: <http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0>

Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently be submitted for publication elsewhere. The program chairs will apply the principles of the ACM Plagiarism Policy throughout the submission and review process.

### Publications

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Authors will be given a brief opportunity for a reply to the reviews. The replies will be considered in the PC's discussions, and considered in the selection of the best reviewer. All accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (www.springer.com/lncs). All papers must be formatted according to the Springerâ€™s Lecture Notes in Computer Science style.

Authors of best papers from the conference will be invited to revise and submit extended versions of their papers for a special issue of the Journal on Science of Computer Programming. 

### Important Dates

{% include 2014/dates %}

### Awards

* Best paper.  Award for best overall paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee.
* Best reviewer.  Award for best reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs using feedback from the authors.
