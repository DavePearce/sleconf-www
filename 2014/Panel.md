## Education of language engineers

### Summary

This 45min (short!) tutorial is about the role of software language engineering in CS curricula. In very few places, designated SLE courses are installed. In a few more places, related courses on compiler construction, domain-specific languages, or model-driven engineering installed. More often than not, such courses are not installed or they are non-mandatory or they are only covered in the Master. From a pro-SLE point of view, this situation suggests two major discussion topics. Firstly, what are viable options for curriculum adaptation so that more curricula in more places have a modest language engineering course for many students? Secondly, how are diverse existing course subjects to be adapted so that elements of language engineering crosscuts diverse courses and reaches most students?

### Topics
* What is SLE anyway from a students point of view?
* Experiences with existing SLE-ish course installations
* Is this even the goal – designated SLE courses?
* That is, is there a correspondence of conferences and courses?
* What are the courses that should be enriched by SLE material?

### Format
* 2min intro by moderator
* 2-3min statement per panelist
* 30mins moderated comments, questions, answers
