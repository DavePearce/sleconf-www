The 7th International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of [software languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_language): their design, their implementation, and their evolution. 

SLE 2014 is to be held on September 14 and 15 2014, co-located with [ASE](http://ase2014.org/) and [GPCE](http://program-transformation.org/GPCE14) in [Västerås, Sweden](http://goo.gl/maps/W2COv).

SLE's mission is to fuse several communities that have traditionally looked at software languages from different and yet complementary perspectives: programming languages, model driven engineering, domain specific languages, semantic web, and from different technological spaces: context-free grammars, object-oriented modeling frameworks, rich data, structured data, object-oriented programming, functional programming, logic programming, term-rewriting, attribute grammars, algebraic specification, etc.
