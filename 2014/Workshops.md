### Call for workshop proposals

SLE 2014 sollicits pre-conference workshop proposals. The goal of such a
workshop is to work on, discuss or teach a particular aspect of Software
Language Engineering. Typically people could be invited to submit position
papers to such workshops, but we do not expect a program committee or a
publication venue.

### Expected workshops

* [ITSLE](ITSLE.html) - This is the yearly workshop for the industrial perspective on SLE.
* [Parsing@SLE](Parsing-at-SLE.html) - This workshop was organized the first time in 2013, and will be organized again to bring together as many parsing experts as possible.
