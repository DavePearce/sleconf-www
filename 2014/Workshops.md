### Call for workshop proposals

SLE 2014 solicits pre-conference workshop proposals. We are most interested in workshops that are not simply mini-conferences but more informal gatherings of like-minded people to work on, discuss or teach a particular aspect of Software Language Engineering.

In such workshops people might be invited to submit position papers to help frame or prime the workshop discussions, but we do not expect workshops to have a significant program committee or a to be a publication venue.

### Expected workshops

* [ITSLE](ITSLE.html "ITSLE")[ITSLE](ITSLE.html) - This workshop explores SLE concepts from an industrial perspective.
* [Parsing@SLE](Parsing-at-SLE.html) - This workshop was organized the first time in 2013 and brought together a wide variety of people intereseted in parsing.

### Submit a proposal!

If you have an idea for a workshop at SLE 2014 please email Eric Van Wyk, the workshop chair, at evw@umn.edu.
