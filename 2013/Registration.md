Registration for SLE 2013 is via SPLASH. You can find all the details about registering for SLE 2013 and attending the conference (including travel suggestions and hotel bookings) here: http://splashcon.org/2013/attending.

To attend just SLE 2013, you need to register for the 2-Days Workshop/Symposia (Sunday and Monday, corresponding to 27-28 October). If you also want to attend the workshops on Saturday 26 October, you need to register for an additional day. During the registration process, please be sure to indicate that you intend to attend SLE 2013. 

Your 2-Days Workshop/Symposia registration will get you access to all sessions on Sunday/Monday (so you can move between all parallel events), and a ticket to the GPCE/SLE reception. Lunches are not included.

Please note: SLE is not an ACM sponsored conference, and thus it is not possible to apply for a travel grant from the SIGPLAN PAC.
