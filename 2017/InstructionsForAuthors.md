title: Instructions for Authors

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.

#### Concurrent Submissions

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by [SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication). Submitters should also be aware of [ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy). 

#### Format

Submissions should use the [ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/), *10 point font*, using the font family [Times New Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman). All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the provided ACM SIGPLAN Templates provided [here](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Otherwise, follow the author instructions. 

Note that by default the SIGPLAN Conference Format templates produce papers in 9 point font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the preprint option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.

#### Page Limit

To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, submissions of research papers should be no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliographic references. Tool papers are limited to 4 pages, excluding 1 optional page with bibliographic references, and excluding max. 4 pages of tool demonstration outline.

#### Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)

__AUTHORS TAKE NOTE__: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
