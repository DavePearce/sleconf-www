# CALL FOR PAPERS

Please consider the [Instructions for Authors](http://sleconf.org/2017/InstructionsForAuthors.html) section for more information including formatting instructions.

### Topics of Interest

SLE aims to be broad-minded and inclusive about relevance and scope. We solicit high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain of language engineering. Topics relevant to SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather than aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is interested in principled engineering approaches and techniques in the following areas:

- Language Design and Implementation
    - Approaches and methodologies for language design 
    - Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints)
    - Techniques for behavioral / executable semantics
    - Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation)
    - Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches
- Language Validation
     - Verification and formal methods for languages
     - Testing techniques for languages
     - Simulation techniques for languages
- Language Integration and Composition
     - Coordination between of heterogeneous languages and tools
     - Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages)
     - Traceability between languages
     - Deployment of languages to different platforms
- Language Maintenance
     - Software language reuse
     - Language evolution 
     - Language families and variability 
- Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance)
- Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools
      - User studies evaluating usability 
      - Performance benchmarks
      - Industrial applications

### Types of Submissions

- **Research papers**: These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography (in [ACM SIGPLAN conference style](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/)).

- **Tool papers**: Because of SLE's interest in tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (see above), with 1 optional additional page for bibliographic references, and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 4 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords “Tool Demo” or “Tool Demonstration” in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 4-page demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission.

- **Industrial papers**: These should describe real-world application scenarios of SLE in industry, explained in their context with an analysis of the challenges that were overcome and the lessons which the audience can learn from this experience. Industry paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages (in ACM SIGPLAN conference style).

- **New ideas / vision papers**: New ideas papers should describe new, non-conventional SLE research approaches that depart from standard practice. They are intended to describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investigation. Vision papers are intended to present new unifying theories about existing SLE research that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4 pages (in ACM SIGPLAN conference style).

**Workshops:** Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience.

### Artifact Evaluation

For the second year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of the artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit artifacts. For more information, have a look at the [Artifact Evaluation](http://www.sleconf.org/2017/ArtifactEvaluation.html) page.


### Publications

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. All accepted papers, including tool papers will be published in ACM Digital Library.  

Authors of distinguished papers from the conference will be invited to revise and submit extended versions of their papers for a Journal special issue.

### Journal Special Issue 

Selected accepted papers will be invited to a special issue of the Computer Languages, Systems and Structures (COMLAN) journal.

### Awards

- Distinguished paper. Award for most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee.

- Distinguished reviewer. Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs using feedback from the authors.

- Distinguished artefact. Award for the artifact most significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee.

### More Information

For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions please contact the Program Chairs.
